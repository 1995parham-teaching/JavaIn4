## Project

Implement a distributed calculator that can calculate locally or over the network.
In the local mode, it calculates the simple arithmetic operations on the local system and in the network mode,
it sends simple arithmetic operations over the TCP connection the server that is configured by the user.
To demonstrate the usage of threads we add a random sleep period in calculations so they take time and create a need
for threading.
This calculator must have a simple and easy to implement user interface.
